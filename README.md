# Books Galore

[(See it in action)](https://books-galore.herokuapp.com/)

Books Galore uses the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview) to return a list of books with title, author, publishing company, and picture, based on the user's search parameter. It was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (including React's default starter code) and deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home). It is a single-page app.
